# Credential Authentication

This project demonstrates a credential authentication system that securely handles user login and registration. It implements features like password hashing, user verification, and session management to ensure secure access to protected resources.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Securely registers users by hashing their passwords using industry-standard algorithms.
- **User Login**: Verifies user credentials to grant access to authenticated users.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions to maintain authentication across different pages while preventing unauthorized access.
- **Password Hashing**: Uses secure algorithms to hash passwords, ensuring that sensitive information is not stored in plaintext.
- **Authentication**: Protects restricted areas of the site and ensures only authorized users can access sensitive content.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Specify the framework or language used (e.g., Node.js, Python, Flask, etc.)
- **Authentication**: Specify the authentication strategy (e.g., JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- **Database**: Specify the database technology (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Frontend**: Specify the frontend technology (e.g., React, HTML/CSS, etc.)
